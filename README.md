### Initial thoughts

It sounds like there's no hidden edge-cases in the challenge. However, it will take some effort/time to put together a solution.

The main concerns as far as I can tell are:

* Add a database index on all sortable fields
* Add a database full-text search index to the searchable fields
* Implement SQL pagination to prevent fetching thousands of records at once
* CSV download should stream the data to the client, avoiding loading a heaps of data to memory
* Avoid counts, perhaps use `EXPLAIN` and extract an approximate number of rows

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT count(*) FROM items;

Aggregate  (cost=20834.00..20834.01 rows=1 width=0)
  ->  Seq Scan on items  (cost=0.00..18334.00 rows=1000000 width=0)
```

### Goals

A Naive implementation follow the steps bellow:

* Start-off with simple Phoenix Web Application generated by: `mix phx.new --live --binary-id --database postgres nfl_rushing`
* Create a simple schema to represent the Player and the Rushing stats
* Create a mix task to load Player and the Rushing stats data from JSON files
* Leverage LiveView + PubSub to implement a rich UI
    * Table with Pagination
    * Sorting
    * (nice to have) Autocomplete
* Deploy on Heroku
